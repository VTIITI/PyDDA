Pythonic multiple doppler package

This package is a rewrite of the Potvin et al. (2012) and Shapiro et al (2009) wind retrieval techniques into a purely Pythonic package for easier integration with Py-ART and Python. This new package uses a faster minimization technique, L-BFGS-B, which provides a factor of 2 to 5 speedup versus using Multidop, as well as a more elegant syntax as well as support for an arbitrary number of radars (at least 2).

The user has an option to adjust strength of data, mass continuity constraints as well as implement a low pass filter. This new version now also has an option to plot a horizontal cross section of a wind barb plot overlaid on a background field from a grid. 

The code here is based off of Potvin et al. (2012) and Shapiro et al. (2009).

Angles.py is from Multidop and was written by Timothy Lang of NASA.

Right now this has been tested on and depends on:

    Python 3.5+

    Py-ART 1.9.0
    
    scipy 1.0.1
    
    numpy 1.13.1
    
    matplotlib 1.5.3
    
    cartopy 0.15.1
    
In addition, in order to use the capability to load HRRR data as a constraint, the [cfgrib](https://github.com/ecmwf/cfgrib) package is needed. Since this does not work on Windows, this is an optional depdenency for those who wish to use HRRR data. To install cfgrib, simply do:

    pip install cfgrib

## Installation instructions
Right now there is only one method to install PyDDA, which is from source. To
do this, just type in the following commands assuming you have the above 
dependencies installed.

```
git clone https://github.com/rcjackson/PyDDA
cd PyDDA
python setup.py install
```
